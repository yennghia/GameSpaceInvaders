# Step 8 - Enemy lasers

[Play this version](https://rawgit.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/JavaScript2/master/Projects/space-game/step08/index.html)

Just like our player can fire lasers, we now let our enemies fire lasers as well. The code is very similar.

The main difference is that the cooldown is now set *per enemy*. This implies that every enemy could fire at a different time, but that's currently not the case. In the next step, we'll introduce randomness.

(Also, our lasers don't actually destroy the player -- that will have to wait for a bit later still.)
